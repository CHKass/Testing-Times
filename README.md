# Testing-Times
Testing Git, GitHub and GitHub Desktop ways.

I'm making this comment on the pull request but am still not quite sure what this file is! I am doing it within the GitHub environment so it isn't really code (or is it?) This Readme file is simply for comments etc, I think. I may try to merge it if I can in the expectation that it can simply be changed at a later date.
